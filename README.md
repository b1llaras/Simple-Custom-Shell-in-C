A custom shell with pipelining capabiltities. It does not support I/O redirection. 
<br>This was one of my assignments for CS110 course that involves building a shell in C

## How to run:
```bash
gcc shell.c -o shell
./shell
```
<li>Enter command after the "my_shell$" promt
<li>The program will terminate when the user types in "exit"
